Hi, my name is Linda and I live on beautiful Vancouver Island, BC CanadaðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦  I found my true passion in the art of photography when I retired. My journey through the lens has been nothing short of captivating. From the moment I held a camera it became a challenge to seek fleeting, extraordinary moments gifted by the natural world and put them into photos. As you view my photos may you too find solace, wonder, and a renewed appreciation for the world that surrounds us all.
